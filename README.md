# Biohazard-Detector-Biohack2023


## Inspiration
We created this project to help automate the waste separation process. Often times this process is lengthy, and even dangerous for sanitation workers. 

## What it does
Classifies waste as hazardous or not depending on what it sees using computer vision. Conveyor belt demonstrates how workers can avoid touching waste.

## Challenges
- Physical prototype
- Conveyor belt material
- Crashes with the code due to format differences in code
