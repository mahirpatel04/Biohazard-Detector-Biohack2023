# Biohazard-Detector-Biohack2023


## Inspiration
We created this project to help automate the waste separation process. Often times this process is lengthy, and even dangerous for sanitation workers. 

## What it does
Classifies waste as hazardous or not depending on what it sees using computer vision. Conveyor belt demonstrates how workers can avoid touching waste.

## Challenges
- Physical prototype
- Conveyor belt material
- Crashes with the code due to format differences in code

## Achievements
- Functioning conveyor belt out of household items
- 2/3 members were first time hackathon participants
- Used Teachable Machine to create a basic level machine learning model 

## Plans to Improve
- Use Arduino Kits to motorize the conveyor belt
- Expand machine learning's dataset to detect chemicals, radioactivity
- Use paddles (similar to a pinball machine) to guide trash into different bins depending on classification
